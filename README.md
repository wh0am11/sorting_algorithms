# sorting_algorithms
A program that displays different types of sorting algorithms. There are currently 5 sorting algorithms that I've written here.

This is a pretty simple program:


`./sort [algorithm] [list]`

Where `algorithm` is any of the current 5 algorithms that exist:


* quicksort
* merge_sort
* selection_sort
* insertion_sort
* bubble_sort 


And `list` is an array of integers.
